Instructions to use this repo are available in this blog:

https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2025/10/06/using-argo-cd-agent-openshift-gitops

While not part of the blog, some POC level instructions for using cert-manager instead of `argocd-agentctl` to
manage the PKI required by the Agent can be found [here](https://github.com/gitops-examples/openshift-gitops-agent/blob/main/cert-manager/cert-manager.md).
